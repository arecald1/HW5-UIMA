We focused on adding all functionality required by the app.
We implemented our own design changes into the app based on what we thought was intuitive such as
making the taskUpdate a separate fragment.

We also tried to reuse as much code as possible such as in the expandedTaskFrag class where we were
able to avoid using two fragments (uncomplete and complete) by selectively choosing widget visibilities.
